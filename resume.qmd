I’m a curious and creative human, with a passion for data of all sorts. I love wrangling unconventional data or using a visualization to foster understanding and promote data literacy. I’m a pro at building backend data apps, write some mean documentation, and am learning frontend.

I have worked on a wide variety of client projects, from AI-generated graffiti and time series modeling, to advanced analytics and data visualization. I thrive in environments where curiosity, creativity and rabbit holes are encouraged.

In my free time, you’ll find me swimming, sailing, swing dancing, or leading a tour around downtown Boston – come along for a stroll to be inundated with fun facts!
