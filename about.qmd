Howdy, I'm Caro, short for Caroline! 

I'm a curious and creative human, with a passion for data of all sorts. I love wrangling unconventional data, or using a visualization to build understanding and promote data literacy.

I have worked on a wide variety of client projects, from AI-generated graffiti and time series modeling to advanced analytics and data visualization. I thrive in environments where data, curiosity, creativity and rabbit holes are encouraged.

In my spare time, youâ€™ll probably find me outside: either biking fast, wandering the neighborhood or playing Spikeball.

Feel free to give a holler!

If you know me, you know the keys to my heart are good group photos, themed parties and data of all shapes, sizes and flavors.
