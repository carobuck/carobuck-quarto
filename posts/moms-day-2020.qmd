A couple weeks ago, I got a note from my mother. The card was gray, with floral designs on it. I recognized it immediately, because I'd made these cards for her; it was (and probably will be for a long time to come) one of my favorite gifts I've ever given. 

For Mother's Day 2020, I polled my mother's friends and family to get a glimpse of how they perceived her (via when they met, how they knew each other and personality traits my mother expressed in their relationship). After collecting all the data, I came up with a floral design that celebrates the unique person my mother is, and shows how cherished and important she is to many. 

My favorite part of this project was seeing how others described my mother- some similar to my own opinions and others totally different!
