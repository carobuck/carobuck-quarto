Why is it important to talk to people about data? Great question, I'd love to tell you.
![](imgs/banner.png){fig-alt="a hand-drawn banner of confetti"}

#### Hello + Welcome to the party!

Quick introduction for context: I'm Caro (short for Caroline) and I'm a data scientist at a marketing agency working on a creative tech team. Meaning that I don't do much traditional marketing analytics, moreover my team makes cool data toys^[We make web apps, prototypes and more, and sometimes use tech and data in not-quite-conventional ways. ] and goes down a lot of weird rabbit holes. 

This article is about talking to people who think they're not data people. It's an invitation to a new kind of party- a data party! 

Like a good party invite, it's a lot more fun if you've got all the
details down (unless surprise party, but someone else should have the details then). So, let's hop in!

***
So, in 2020, we all kind of became arm chair experts...

If you were thinking COVID-19, then we are thinking the same thing. Data have always had (and still currently do have) a large impact in our lives, but the various impacts over time have not always been visible. Thanks to a global pandemic, data suddenly moved to the forefront and had a very visceral, real and obvious impact in our lives. Statistical jargon became commonplace in casual conversation and numbers, charts and case counts dictated what we should or shouldn't do, who we could see, where we could go. Being able to understand numbers and charts suddenly became crucial to navigate daily life.

#### Data (Mis)conceptions

::: {layout="[55,45]"}
::: {.div}
The average person might have a lot of baggage surrounding data- we've been told (by media, math class, social media, etc.) that data are a bunch of numbers, maybe in table or chart format, and could be big, scary and/or intimidating. 

:::
::: {.div}
TODO insert pic here about what ppl think data are

**So what are data?** Spoiler- all of those things! And so much more! Like in improv comedy, this is a ["yes, and..."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...) situation. Meaning that you take what others offer, and add something to the story. You may shape, refine and take things in a new direction, yet you meet the person where they're currently at. When talking to people about data, it's really important to understand what conceptions they have about data. 

In addition to the above, data are:

* Creative! Despite what we might (think we) want, data are not always "right"- there's a lot more color involved, than just a simple black or white answer. 
* Scientific! While very creative, data are also a rigorous way to study the world around us and collect info 
* Everywhere! The more you look, the more you see! This is what makes data really fun to talk about with other people- just ask my friends and family who've gotten an earful!

Now that we've cleared that up, let's hop into this invitation- don't forget to RSVP!

***
#### Who
Let's quickly clarify who is a "data" person and who is a "non-data" person. You may have noticed the quotes- that's completely intentional.

"Data" person and "non-data" person are usually self-designated labels, perhaps based on one's job function or how good they think they are at math. However, rather than this exclusive view, I believe that everyone can be (and is!) a data person; we all exist somewhere on a spectrum of data readiness and the goal is not to all exist in the same place, rather it is to realize that the spectrum exists, and we can all exist on it in our own place. 

![We all exist somewhere along the data readiness spectrum, somewhere between Novice and Expert.](imgs/rconf_preso_article/Who_Slide_3.png){fig-alt="Handwritten arrow with Novice on left, Expert on right. Arrow with blue asterisk points closer to novice. Sencond arrow points closer to expert"}

It is also worth noting that the line from novice to expert is very likely not a straight line. In reality, the journey to becoming an expert is filled with unexpected twists and turns- and usually once you reach "expert level", you really just realize how much more you still have to learn. There are also multiple paths to expert, and because we can all be experts existing in our own niche worlds, it's worthwhile to to share what we know. To remember that not everyone is following us down the exact same niche rabbitholes, and it's worth looking around, remembering our blindspots and sharing what we have learned with others. 

![Lots of ways to be an expert (none superior over another).](imgs/rconf_preso_article/Who_Slide_4.png){fig-alt="Several handwritten, swirling arrows from Novice on left to Expert on right."}

So when you're looking for people to talk to about data: look around, it's likely that you could talk with anyone. Perhaps holler at a friend or roommate, or if you work in a large organization, talk with folks not on your team, or those you work with obliquely.

#### What

::: {layout="[55,45]"}
::: {.div}
what to say depends on level of person/where they are on data spectrum 
Like are we going full on theme party (maybe into the weeds on a ML model) or staying a bit more high level with some small talk (maybe get excited about an interesting data journalism article you saw float by on Twitter recently) 

The "what" could be educational/entertaining/both ('pique the curiosity'). Depends on the rest of the party invite

Let's take music as a category example and see how we could talk about each thing.

#### Where + When

::: {layout="[55,45]"}
::: {.div}
lol always and forever
consider where people encounter data/viz
Consider: Is this a last minute backyard hangout or a wedding planned
months in advance? 
The where/when and what might also inform the others.
E.g. if you want/need to deep dive on something to bridge
understanding/knowledge gap, it makes sense to set up time in advance to
discuss, so the audience has some sense of what they are getting into.
If you're casually bringing it up in a way to entertain/show another
side of data (e.g. a new/unexpected place to find data, or a creative
data use), the where/when might be over lunch, or a brief meeting in a
hallway, etc

#### Why

::: {.notes}
like mentioned at beginning, data are a lot more than what we might think about.
data are science, and art, AND ACCESSIBILITY TOOL.

Penguins come in all shapes and sizes. Gentoo penguins tend to have the longest flipper length, on average, at **217.2 mm**, compared to Adelie (**190.0 mm**) and Chinstrap (**195.8 mm**) penguins.

::: {.notes}
you could go out an count penguins all day, and maybe that's what you
do. but that's not what I'm gonna do. I rely on others data collection to learn new stuff

this is just one example of how data itself can be used as an accessibility
tool. numbers themselves can be a way to summarise information, and if
we show numbers/data in a particular way, it can make the info more (or
less) clear and accessible to folks.

learn not just about penguins, but also able to interpret current events in world (e.g. covid charts)

you might be wondering, how do I get started? maybe you're ready to go, maybe you want some more prep.
here are some refs to check out for inspiration or other "what"s to talk about w/ ppl

but my main advice? just go for it.
just get started? may very likey feel awk, but just need to jump in and do it

#### Ending on a story

TODO add pic for side by side (add legend too? double stack it)

::: {.notes}
so, a story for why it's selfishly good to talk to "non datas"... 

back near beg of covid, I came across GL's data portraits and wanted to do something similar for my team. 
thought would be fun desk name tag for when we went back to office soon (spoiler, we never went back to office)
but, fun to make and really fun to share w/ my team and guess who's who. fun to get to know each other in a way that wasn't strictly related to work, while working remotely. 
word got around about these and creative lead "you're gonna share w/ the whole C team"
me: "really?!?" so I did. 
it was amazing to be able to share something very data driven, that was also very creative.
(they didn't realize data could be so much more than
reporting/analytics. and when others see the inspiration/possibilities,
we can do cooler things with data!!)

So, we, data people can selfishly do cooler things when others realize our powers and are willing to let data out of the box

#### PS: You *totally* have something worthwhile to share

While preparing to speak at the conference, I came across this article about the [value of publishing your work](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work) by Aaron Francis. 
::: {style="font-size: 1.8em; font-style:bold;"}
"They think that they're not doing anything interesting because they
assume that everyone knows as much as they do...
<br />
As you become more of an expert, your quality bar gets higher and higher and you
forget that everything you know is not known by everyone."
:::

[-Aaron Francis]{style="font-size: xxx-large;"}



to set us up for this talk, I want to share this quote as a little inspo content.
we're all "masters" of something (master being a term that exists on a spectrum and can be loosely defined)
sometimes we forget just how much we know, or we might be "masters" of
different things, and it's worthwhile to remember our blind spots and share what we do know. 

everyone has something to share- don't sit out there and think u have nothing
