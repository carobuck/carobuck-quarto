## THINGS I LEARNED

* making slides in quarto is pretty easy
* doing custom hand drawn backgrounds makes things a liiiittle bit harder. not totally unachievable, but harder because depends on aspect ratio. converting slides to html/article harder since background images don't really work (also looks kinda dumb)
