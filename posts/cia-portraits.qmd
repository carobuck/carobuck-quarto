A few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, I was still optimistic about returning to the office in person and was inspired by lots of data portraits I was seeing around the web (particularly those from [Giorgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/data-portraits-at-ted2017)).

As a result, I decided to poll my coworkers, took a more hands on approach to data viz that I don't typically get to do in my day-to-day job and made some desk signs/personalized portraits for the team. My favorite part in sharing these with the team was having people guess whose was whose!

Of course, any good data viz needs a legend to go along with it:

The hardest part of making these portraits was figuring out the color palette. I wanted to use a bunch of our company's colors from the recent rebrand, but also had to make sure the colors would be distinguishable, still hold meaning and that I wasn't using *too* many.
