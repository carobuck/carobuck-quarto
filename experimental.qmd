### An experimental dumping ground for my random ideas

February 2024: I'm going to sea for a month and have made a [logs site](https://seabuck.netlify.app/) for that adventure. Essentially, I've signed myself up to throw things off the side of a ship in all weather and at all hours. The things we do for a good story. Follow along for more details, photos, and sea fun facts.

One of my goals for this year is to learn more about front end development. To that end, here's a link to my [tinkering site](https://caro-test-react.vercel.app/). </br> </br> *Note: this site is likely hideous at least 80% of the time, and may or may not work.* BUT! *I believe in the importance of authenticity, sharing works in progress before they're "perfect", and want to hold myself accountable to keep exploring and learning new things.*
