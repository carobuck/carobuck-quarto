# da$\cdot$ta par$\cdot$ty
##### *noun* (pl: *data parties*) 
### A gathering, formal or informal, to talk all things data. Can happen wherever, whenever and everyone's invited!

<br/>

If you know me, you know the keys to my heart are good group photos, themed parties and data of all shapes, sizes and flavors. 

So, what are we waiting for?! Let's get going and have some fun!
