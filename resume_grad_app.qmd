*Python* | *R* | *Quarto* | *Flask* | *GCP* | *JS* </br></br>
I'm a curious and creative human, with a passion for data of all sorts. I love wrangling unconventional data, or using a visualization to build understanding and promote data literacy. I'm a pro at building backend data apps, am learning frontend, and write some mean documentation.

I have worked on a wide variety of client projects; from AI-generated graffiti and time series modeling to advanced analytics and data visualization. I thrive in environments where curiosity, creativity and rabbit holes are encouraged.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me swimming, sailing, swing dancing, or leading a tour around Boston- come along for a stroll to be inundated with fun facts!
