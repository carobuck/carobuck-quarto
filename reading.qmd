# Books I've Read

I've always liked to read (growing up, I took a book everywhere, much to my mother's chagrin when she'd have to sit in silence driving me around whilst I read), but now I keep proper track of what I'm reading. 

See what I've been reading below- and give a holler if you want my hot take thoughts on any of the books. If you have a book you think I should read, suggest it [here](https://forms.gle/bphDyhxd4HZL6NmAA). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| warning: false

# NOTE: getting warnings of cached tokens, maybe deal with that explicitly here: https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html
books_read <- googlesheets4::read_sheet('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gi6fonQAa5Md71xMNGMVMz-lSdjBvD3IkDff1pmXpfI/')
books_read |>
  #filter(`Date Completed` != '2019') %>%
  dplyr::mutate(`Date Completed` = lubridate::as_date(`Date Completed`)) |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(`Date Completed`)) |>
  dplyr::select(c(`Date Completed`,Title,Author)) |>
  knitr::kable(caption='Note: Books completed in 2019 did not have great tracking, so date is approximate')
```
