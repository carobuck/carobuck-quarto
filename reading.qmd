# Books I've Read

Growing up, I took a book everywhere, much to my mother's annoyance when she'd have to sit in silence driving me around while I read. Nowadays, I still read just as much, but I keep proper track of what I'm reading. 

See what I've been reading below -- and give a holler if you want my hot take thoughts on any of the books. If you have a book you think I should read, please [suggest it](https://forms.gle/bphDyhxd4HZL6NmAA).
